/*
	Minimal implementation of a USB serial port, using the CDC class.
	This example application simply echoes everything it receives right back
	to the host.

	Windows:
	Extract the usbser.sys file from .cab file in C:\WINDOWS\Driver Cache\i386
	and store it somewhere (C:\temp is a good place) along with the usbser.inf
	file. Then plug in the LPC176x and direct windows to the usbser driver.
	Windows then creates an extra COMx port that you can open in a terminal
	program, like hyperterminal.

	Linux:
	The device should be recognised automatically by the cdc_acm driver,
	which creates a /dev/ttyACMx device file that acts just like a regular
	serial port.

/* Modified by Sagar G V, Feb 2011
Used the USB CDC example to create a library. Added the following functions

void VCOM_puts(const char* str); //writes a null terminated string. 
void VCOM_putc(char c); // writes a character.
void VCOM_putHex(uint8_t hex); // writes 0x.. hex value on the terminal.
char VCOM_getc(); // returns character entered in the terminal. blocking function
void VCOM_gets(char* str); // returns a string. '\r' or '\n' will terminate character collection.
char VCOM_getc_echo(); // returns character entered and echoes the same back.
void VCOM_gets_echo(char *str); // gets string terminated in '\r' or '\n' and echoes back the same.
