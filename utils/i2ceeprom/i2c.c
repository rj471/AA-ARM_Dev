 *   2010.07.19  ver 1.10    Rob Jansen - MyVoice CAD/CAM Services:
 *                           Major cleaning an a rewrite of some functions
 *                           - adding ACK/NACK handling to the state machine
 *                           - adding a return result to the I2CEngine()
 *   2011.02.08	 ver 1.200   J. Harwood - ported to LPC17xx
